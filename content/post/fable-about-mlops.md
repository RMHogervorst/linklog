## Fable About Mlops
Is a fable written by Alex Burlacu and can be found at [Alex' website](https://alexandruburlacu.github.io/posts/2022-11-22-mlops-fable)


## what do I think about it
This is a very nice story about how you MUST start small in mlops and only build what you need. 
Starting with everything is a recipe for disaster.
