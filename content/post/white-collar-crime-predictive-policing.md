## White Collar Crime Predictive Policing
This [project by the new inquiry](https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/) shows you what predictive policing does but applies it to a class of crime that is never part of these predictions: white collar crime.

>  White Collar Crime Risk Zones uses machine learning to predict where financial crimes are mostly likely to occur across the US. To learn about our methodology, read our white paper.

By Brian Clifton, Sam Lavigne and Francis Tseng for The New Inquiry Magazine, Vol. 59: ABOLISH.

## what do I think about it
This map show what many of the predictive policing applications also show: crime happens where there are people. It is not strange to see financial crimes peak in the middle of the financial district of New York. And it is not strange to see pickpockets in the city centre. What matters is what you do with it.
