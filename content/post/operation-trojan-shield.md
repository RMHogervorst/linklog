## Operation Trojan Shield
Is a podcast episode by Malicious Life and can be found at [their website](https://malicious.life/designed-by-criminals-for-criminals-operation-trojan-shield/)

About service called Anon. Set up specifically to be enticing for criminals. 

> The Anom was the holy grail of dark, illegal communication: a mobile phone that could send encrypted messages, and even included a secret Kill-Switch to foil attempts by law enforcement agents to get to its contents. Thousands of criminals used the Anom, certain that they were completely safe from the police... They were wrong.
