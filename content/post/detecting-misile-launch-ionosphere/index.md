## Detecting Misile Launches in the Ionosphere

This is bananas. Not really data science, but slightly data engineering related.
There were papers showing you should be able to detect missile launches but these
two people actually did it. Interesting to hear the data engineering aspects of it.

> Tyler Nighswander and Mike Nute have developed an incredible tool for detecting long-range missile and space launches by processing and visualizing ionospheric disturbances in GPS data.Â
