## Digital Defense Playbook
Is an amazing resource to talk about oppression, community and data.
The book contains exercises and thoughtfull commentary.
The book can be found [at odbproject.org](https://www.odbproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ODB_DDP_HighRes_Single.pdf). 


> Our Data Bodies (ODB) has conducted research and produced a workbook
of popular education activities focused on data, surveillance, and
community safety to co-create and share knowledge, analyses, and tools
for data justice and data access for equity. We hope that this project will
be helpful to movements for justice grounded in peoples’ realities. We
hope that our work will enhance trusted models of community health
and safety and help illuminate the differences between being safe and
being secure. We wish this Digital Defense Playbook, with all its activities,
tools, tip sheets, and reflection pieces, will support organizations and
community members involved in intersectional fights for racial justice,
LGBTQ liberation, feminism, immigrant rights, economic justice, and other
freedom struggles, to help us understand and address the impact of data-
based technologies on our social justice work.

> The Digital Defense Playbook (DDP) can be facilitated as a
series of community-based workshops or as individual, stand-alone workshops. Each
session is developed to run from between 45 and 90 minutes and, if possible, can
be successfully implemented in a 2-hour window of time. It can be restrictive for
participants to share thoughts and ideas in less than 45 minutes, as these topics are
complex, and we want to ensure that we are leaving our community members with a
sense of power, not paranoia. Be sure there is uninterrupted access to a room for the
activities to take place. Make reservations ahead of time, if necessary.
PARTICIPANTS: DDP activities, tools, and tips are designed primarily for People
of Color (POC) and members of other marginalized communities, including poor, trans
Queer, unhoused, and previously incarcerated people, as the activities were developed
directly out of the stories and experiences of these same communities. At the same
time, this guide can be used in any community. We do recommend organizers be
mindful of protecting the group’s safety and vulnerability, where necessary, in order to
grow and maintain trust for session participants. These spaces are designed to allow
our community members to speak uncensored about their experiences with racism,
oppression, violence, and other forms of systematic violence without the fear of being
silenced or overshadowed by others with greater privilege.


## what do I think about it
Not only is this great for working with marginalized groups but these exercises can be used to design more inclusive solutions. I think this playbook can be used as inspiration for 'normal' requirements gathering.
