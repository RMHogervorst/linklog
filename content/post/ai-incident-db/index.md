## The AI incident database
Is a collection of public fails of ML products. 

I linked to it before on my [notes blog in 2020](https://notes.rmhogervorst.nl/post/2020/12/03/ai-incident-database/).

There is also [a preprint ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10384)
and a [github project](https://github.com/responsible-ai-collaborative/aiid).
