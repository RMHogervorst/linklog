## Artists Infringing Copyright on Purpose
Deniz Opal [@selzero@vmst.io](https://vmst.io/@selzero) posted screenshots from twitter by [@nonbinaryrobot(@twitter.com)](https://twitter.com/nonbinaryrobot "impossible to see because twitter has gone full instagram and only allows you to see 3 tweets of someone") which I'm now embedding here too.

> Well this has come to a head. In order to protest AI image generators stealing artists work to train AI models, the artists are deliberately generating AI art based on the IP of corporations that are most sensitive to protecting it.

> Who knew the first AI battles would be fought by artists?
> Alt text: pictures contain images of AI generated images of Disney, Nintendo, DC, and Marvel characters.

## what do I think about it
It was clear from the start that artists hate it when you use their work without any attribution. The large image generation models (diffusion models) are trained on huge indiscriminate scrapes of the internet. The companies doing this knew this was shady because they employ universities and researchers to do the actual scraping, because researchers have more leeway. It is impossible to fight large monopsopolies on even ground, you just don't have the money or power. This is an excellent guerilla tactic.

I love how these artists weaponize Disney's famous vicious copyright infringement tactics to force a legal decision. Either way this is a win: or creating copies of 'copyrighted' images is rights free (as the makers of the models claim) or artists are protected and require attribution.
