## Building machine learning products: a problem well-defined is a problem half-solved.
Is a blogpost by Jeremy Jordan and can be found [here](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/ml-requirements/).

> In this post, we'll dig deeper into how to develop the requirements for a machine learning project when you're given a vague problem to solve.

## what do I think about it
Nice to see such a post about understanding the problem.
