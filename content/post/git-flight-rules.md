## Git Flight Rules

> A guide for astronauts (now, programmers using Git) about what to do when things go wrong.

Contains things like 
- I want to remove a file from a commit
- I want to undo a merge 

## what do I think about it
It is just like [oh shit git](https://ohshitgit.com/) which I described [here](/post/oh-shit-git.html)
This is super nice to bookmark and come back to once in a while because you never really completely grok git.
