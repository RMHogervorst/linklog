## A 16–20 Week Roadmap To Review Machine Learning And Learn MLOps
can be found at this[medium address](https://medium.com/coriers/mlops-and-machine-learning-roadmap-95efc59927a2), or this cleaned adres](https://scribe.citizen4.eu/coriers/mlops-and-machine-learning-roadmap-95efc59927a2)



## what is it about
A roadmap to learn everything. (seems silly)

It goes from fundamental math to docker to kubernetes to kubeflow to azure ml
AI-900: Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals.

Then data robot? does it stop here? weird. 


## what do i think about it
So I thing this is a bad idea, do not do this. You can't learn machine learning AND mlops in 20 weeks. You can learn many topics, but you need a real world project and focus.
