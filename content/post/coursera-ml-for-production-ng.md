## Machine Learning Engineering for Production (MLOps) Specialization
Can be found here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-engineering-for-production-mlops)


## what do I think about it
A coursera specialisation about managing machine learning production systems. (takes 4 months to complete) (or take one the 4 underlying courses) is supposed to be realy good.
