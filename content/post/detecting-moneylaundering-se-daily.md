## Detecting Moneylaundering Se Daily
Is an interview with and can be [found here](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2021/09/17/detecting-money-laundering-with-clarence-chio/)

> Money laundering is not a new crime.  However, the growth of digital communications has greatly expanded the opportunity for money launderers to find innovative new ways to hide their true intent.  Some estimates suggest it could be as high as 2-5% of the worldâ€™s GDP.

> Unit21 is a customizable no-code platform for risk and compliance operations.  They offer a simple API and dashboard for detecting and managing money laundering and fraud.  Today on the show, I speak with Clearance Chio, co-founder and CTO of Unit21.
