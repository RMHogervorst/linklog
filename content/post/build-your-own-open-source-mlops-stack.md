## Build your open-source MLOps stack

This [interactive website (mymlops.com)](https://mymlops.com/) let's you select tools and also checks if the tools fit together. 

## what is it about
The website lets you choose components:
- experiment tracking
- experimentation
- data versioning
- code versioning
- pipeline orchestration
- runtime engine
- artefact tracking
- model registry
- model serving
- model monitoring

Runtime engine seems a bit overkill for most usecases but I like the ability to click tools together and someone else checking if that could work. 

With mlops being very vendor heavy it is nice to see open source alternatives. 

Fundamentaly the tools will not make your machine learning projects a success, it's people, mindsets and culture that do that. But this is a very useful tool!
