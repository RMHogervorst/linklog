## Large Language Models like ChatGPT say The Darnedest Things

> On November 30, 2022,  OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by the large language model GPT-3. Although it was not particularly more intelligent or powerful than earlier versions of GPT-3, it caught the attention of the public and the press to an unprecedented degree.

> Needless to say — or, rather, this should be needless to say, but this obvious fact can get buried beneath the ongoing avalanche of hype — ChatGPT made all the same kinds of mistakes that its predecessors did.

> we recently decided to put together a community-facing corpus of ChatGPT errors (and to include other Large Language models as well) We enlisted a few friends  — Jim Hendler, William Hsu, Evelina Leivada, Vered Shwartz, and Michael Witbrock — and the technical help of Michael Ma, and put together this site.
Importantly, we have structured it so that anyone can look at the data at any time.


> There is an interface for adding examples and a separate interface for viewing the collection in database format.  In adding an example, the model that generated it, a brief description of the error, and either a screenshot or the text of the example are required, and, for verification purposes, you must supply an email address, which is not published.  A categorization of error type, a link to a relevant external site (e.g. a posting on social media) and additional comments are optional.

## what do I think about it
This is great, because the LLMs are closed and there is not enough information.
