## Oh Shit Git

> Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about in order to fix your problem.

> So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them in plain english.


## what do I think about it
It is just like [git flight rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) which I described [here](/post/git-flight-rules.html)
This is super nice to bookmark and come back to once in a while because you never really completely grok git.
