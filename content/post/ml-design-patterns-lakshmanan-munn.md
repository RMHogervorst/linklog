## Machine Learning Design Patterns
By Valliappa Lakshmanan, Sara Robinson, and Michael Munn (three engineers from Google).
Can be found [at the open library](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL30185444M/Machine_Learning_Design_Patterns)

I heard about this book from an interview with the authors in an podcast. 


## what is it about
This is a book you that you can peruse, or lookup things whenever you have a question. 
Each chapter asks:
- What is a common problem in machine learning?
- What is the recommended solution?
- What are trade-offs and alternatives?


## what do i think about it
I had high hopes, but it feels basic still. Probably really good overview of 'solved' problems in Machine learning operations. Many chapters don't really fit into the design pattern idea: for example Training a model with stochastic gradient descent. That is not really a design pattern, that's what all models do. 

Anyways, I haven't looked back into the book so I don't think it is useful enough for me.
