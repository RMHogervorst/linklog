## How DALL-E works, plain English, no math, Part 1
Is a super easy explainer of how image generators like dall-e work, and can be found  [here](https://aiascendant.substack.com/p/how-dall-e-works-part-1).

> My goal here is to explain to a broader audience — readers who don’t know calculus, and don’t (yet) understand anything about neural networks — how OpenAI’s DALL-E image generator works, in reasonably thorough and rigorous detail, with a few simple illustrative diagrams … but no math, and no unexplained mathematical terms, whatsoever. Wish me luck. (Of course one reason I’m writing this is to force myself to understand the subject much better myself.)

## what do I think about it

Also explains neural networks, feedforward and feedback, gradient descent. 
This is a really nice explainer for novices.
