## The Evolution of the NLP Landscape with Oren Etzioni
Is a conversation between Oren Etzioni and John Bohannon about NLP and can be found [here](https://twimlai.com/podcast/twimlai/the-evolution-of-the-nlp-landscape-with-oren-etzioni/).


EPISODE 598 November 7, 2022

> Today friend of the show and esteemed guest host John Bohannon is back with another great interview, this time around joined by Oren Etzioni, former CEO of the Allen Institute for AI, where he is currently an advisor. In our conversation with Oren, we discuss his philosophy as a researcher and how that has manifested in his pivot to institution builder. We also explore his thoughts on the current landscape of NLP, including the emergence of LLMs and the hype being built up around AI systems from folks like Elon Musk. Finally, we explore some of the research coming out of AI2, including Semantic Scholar, an AI-powered research tool analogous to arxiv, and the somewhat controversial Delphi project, a research prototype designed to model peopleâ€™s moral judgments on a variety of everyday situations.


## what do I think about it
Oren said something about intelligence in these models that I really like: 
"LLM are essentially mirrors, if you see intelligence, it is a reflection of your own intelligence." 
John said something similar: "A model is a Data telescope, you are essentially  looking at our own history."
