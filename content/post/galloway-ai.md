## AI
Is a great introduction on what the state of ML models is at the end of 2022 and can be found [at his website](https://www.profgalloway.com/ai/).

- billions go into funding (mostly private secret companies)
- transformers are revolution
- image generation is super advanced right now
- text generation is coming

> Similar to any tech that scales, or any mechanism that refines one thing into another, creating economic value, AI brings externalities. AIs that evaluate résumés tend to favor White men, because that’s who’s in the sample set. AIs that evaluate crime risk tend to disfavor Black men, for similar reasons. It’s computationally intensive and requires expensive data centers that only governments and the wealthiest companies can afford. But it has a story, and utility. Something 2021 and 2022’s technologies (Web 3.0 and the metaverse) did not offer.


## what do I think about it
I'm glad I no longer see the stupid 'AI is conscious' posts, I don't like that we depend on billionaires for these models. I do find the techniques interesting.
