## Feature engineering and selection a short guide
[Feature engineering and selection a short guide - Yimeng-Zhang](https://github.com/Yimeng-Zhang/feature-engineering-and-feature-selection/blob/master/A%20Short%20Guide%20for%20Feature%20Engineering%20and%20Feature%20Selection.md) A primer about how to do feature engineering in python.
