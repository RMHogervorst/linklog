We hear how the LinkedIn team got to this point, having an open source release, and how they used LinkedIn as an incubator to build a great product. // Bio David Stein is a tech lead at LinkedIn working on machine learning feature infrastructure. He is the original architect of Feathr and continues to contribute to its development as well as to other parts of LinkedIn's machine learning platform.
