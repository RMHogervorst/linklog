## title

Can be found at <https://www.coursera.org/learn/mlops-fundamentals>

## what is it about

- Identify and use core technologies required to support effective MLOps.
- Adopt the best CI/CD practices in the context of ML systems.
- Configure and provision Google Cloud architectures for reliable and effective MLOps environments.
- Implement reliable and repeatable training and inference workflows.


Contains introduction to kubernetes, google AI pipelines (a google product), tuning a model, kubeflow pipelines and CI/CD things with AI pipelines.

## what do I think about it
I haven't done these courses, so I can't really evaluate them. I think basic kubernetes knowledge, kubeflow pipelines are super useful.
